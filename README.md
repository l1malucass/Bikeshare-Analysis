# US Bikeshare Masterschool Project

Welcome to my first ever project.

The project consists of creating a dynamic Python program that interacts with the user using pandas and data frame manipulation. The data is from Bikeshare, restricted with three different cities: Chicago, New York and Washington.

- In the file "Arquivo.zip" you will find the csv files cointaning the dataset
- In the file "bikeshare2.py" you will find the program
